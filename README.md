# Simple Web Application Coding Challenge
> Welcome to the Geekwise Restaurant Ordering Web Application Challenge

## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a simple restaurant ordering web application, and provide the source files by sending a link of your github repository when you have completed the project. You will be asked to build the project in either the [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/) javascript framework.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app** given a set of screens. Your github flow and processes will also be assessed. 

## The Challenge

You will begin by creating your own project repository naming it "geekwise-restaurant-application"

You are to build the project in either the [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/) javascript based framework. The designs for the project are provided for you in the [screens](./screens/) folder. You must also use a styling framework to help create a responsively styled application. *Bootstrap is preferred. 

Although this is a basic exercise, we'll be looking for **simple, well-designed, performant, and tested code** in the submission.

Please include a `README` with setup instructions, and any tests or other documentation you created as part of your solution.

Also, add the following info to your `README`:

- Why did you decide on the framework choice you used as part of your solution?
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- What would you do differently if you were given more time?

## Details

You will need to build the following 4 pages:

- A "Landing" page
- A "Login" page
- An "Order" page
- A "View Orders" page

Please create components for each part of the page (eg. header, navigation menu, footer, etc). It is ok to use static content for this project.

The pages must be responsive and usable on mobile and tablet devices.

### "Landing" Page

Refer to the [screens/1-landing.png](./screens/1-landing.png) screen.

The "Go To Login" button must navigate to the login screen.

### "Login" Page

Refer to the [screens/2-login.png](./screens/2-login.png) screen.

The login page will contain a simple form with an email and password inputs. The login button must navigate to the Order page.

### "Order" Page

Refer to the [screens/3-order.png](./screens/3-order.png) screen.

The order page will contain a simple form with the ability to select from a minimum of 4 lunch items, set the quantity of the items being ordered and contain an order now button. A simple success alert upon ordering must be added.

### "View Orders" Page

Refer to the [screens/4-view-orders.png](./screens/4-view-orders.png) screen.

The view orders screen should contain a minimum of two orders that have been submitted. If possible you should create data sets and services that dynamically allow you to add an order and view recent orders. However, it is ok to have hard coded content in this project.

## Bonus!

While it is ok to add hard coded content for this project, it will be a bonus if you can create data models, and services that allow you to dynamically submit an order as well as view recent orders.

## Bonus Bonus!

Extra bonus if you create your own API that allows you to login, submit orders and view recent orders

## Github Programming Flow

It will be important that you create a branch for each screen and feature that you program. After each screen or featured component is completed merge your work to your main working branch. We will assess your github flow and practices as part of your coding challenge
